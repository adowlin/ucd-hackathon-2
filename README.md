### Strategy

Intro: 

Create a portfolio website for a Tara a fictional junior software developer looking to advertise their skills to clients. 

User Stories: As a prospective client, I want to be able to view the site on any device.

As a prospective client, I want to be able to access all pages easily so that I can navigate throughout the site without any confusion.

As a prospective client, I want to be able to view the site owners previous projects so I can review their work to ensure they have the skills I need in a developer.

As a prospective client, I want to be able to review the site owners skills to ensure they align to the technologies used for my service.

As a prospective client, I want to be able to read a short biography about the site owner to get a better understanding of their personality.

As a prospective client, I want to be able to view the site ownerâ€™s CV along with a history of their work and education so I can be assured that they are qualified for the role. 

As a prospective client, I want to be able to contact the site owner via an intuitive contact form.
